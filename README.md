# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis on Tweets Using Naive Bayes

A concise NLP project performing sentiment classification on Twitter data using Naive Bayes and visualization in Jupyter Notebooks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository implements sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets (e.g., `snapdeal_tweets.csv`) using Python and NLP techniques. 
It classifies each tweet as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** based on textual content, leveraging a Naive Bayes classifier.
